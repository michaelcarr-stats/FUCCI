This repository is the culmination of the work done in Carr et al. (2021). In `Data` you will find the 
data used in this project from raw to processed. In `R` and `MATLAB` you will find the code 
(in the respective languages) used to simulate the collective cell spreading experiment from the
Simpson et al. (2018) model, the Sequential Monte Carlo Approximate Bayesian Computation (SMC-ABC) 
algorithm used to estimate the model parameters, and any other helper functions. In `Plot Functions (R)` 
you will find the `R` script used to produce the figures in Carr et al. (2021). Finally, in 
`Computational Efficiency (R)` you will find an `R` script which computes the computational
cost of simulating the model.
